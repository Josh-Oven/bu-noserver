Seeing her now just makes my skin crawl,\" Roger said, staring at the ceiling of his psychiatrist's office.\n\"And the medications I prescribed you haven't been helping? You still hallucinate that you're suddenly transported to see ex-girlfriend Liz?\" Dr. Meadows asked.\n\"It just happened again two weeks ago. One minute I'm getting ready for work. Then I step out my front door and suddenly I'm on the other side of the state. And there she is looking all weepy and stuff.\"\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\"I turned around and left, just like I've been doing. Took three buses and a cab to get home. Somehow managed to not get fired.\"\nThe doctor nodded her head slowly. \"I have to be honest with you Roger, your case is baffling to me. Your hallucinations are remarkably complex and vivid, and all manage to hold some kind of strange internal consistency, save for the fact that you magically teleport to other places.\"\n\"I've heard this speech before Dr. Meadows. You're my third psychiatrist. I hoped that this new cocktail of drugs was going to do the trick too. But it sounds like I'm just certifiably crazy. Save your breath, and don't bother trying to refer me to someone else. I guess I'll just have to live with it.\"\n\"I wasn't going to refer you away Roger. Your case is baffling to me, but I enjoy the challenge. We need to try some out of the box thinking here. Avoiding your hallucinations doesn't seem to be working. When you get home from here, I want you to look up your old high school flame and call her. The real one. Maybe some connection to the real version of her will help you move on from your subconscious' obsession with her.\"\n    \"Isn't that going to seem a bit, I dunno, stalker-ish?\"\n\"It might,\" she said, standing to show Roger out. \"But have you really got anything to lose?\"\n\"I guess not,\" he answered. He stepped out of her office, pulling the door shut behind him.\nAs the door clicked shut, the hardwood floor of the office was instantly replaced with muddy grass. Heavy drops of rain pelted him from dark clouds hanging in the sky. A chill wind blew right through the thin jacket he was wearing.\nRoger looked around. He was standing in a cemetery. There was Liz, standing over an open grave, clinging tightly to an umbrella. A preacher of some kind stood in front of the grave, droning on in the bored tone of a man who wasn't getting paid enough to eulogize a man he didn't care about.\nLiz lifted her gaze from the grave, and her tear filled eyes met Roger's. He turned and started to walk away, but stopped. Roger turned back and looked at her. She was still staring at him, but now her expression turned to confusion.\nRoger hesitated a moment longer, then started walking toward her. She seemed to recoil slightly as he came and stood next to her. He looked at the grave marker. It was for Liz's dad.\nThe two of them stood there wordlessly while the preacher finished his ceremony. Finally, he snapped his book closed, and nodded in the direction of the two of them. The preacher turned on heel, and left them standing by the open grave.\n\"I'm sorry, about your dad,\" Roger said finally.\n\"Thanks,\" Liz said softly. \"You haven't talked to me in a long time.\"\n\"Not since high school.\"\n  \"I thought all those times I saw you walking away meant I was getting better. Somehow I'm glad that you're here though. It's better than being alone. But I guess this means I'm still crazy,\" she said.\n  Roger looked at her, studying her expression. \"Who isn't these days?\" he asked after a pause.\n  She let a small laugh escape her lips. Liz looked at him, and smiled. It was the first time Roger had seen that since they had broken up.\n\"Would you stay here with me a while?\" she asked softly, tears starting to well back up in her eyes.\n\"Sure,\" Roger answered. What did he have to lose?\n"

Your case is baffling to me, but I enjoy the challenge. We need to try some out of the box thinking here. Avoiding your hallucinations doesn't seem to be working. When you get home from here, I want you to look up your old high school flame and call her. The real one. Maybe some connection to the real version of her will help you move on from your subconscious' obsession with her.\"\n    \"Isn't that going to seem a bit, I dunno, stalker-ish?\"\n\"It might,\" she said, standing to show Roger out. \"But have you really got anything to lose?\"\n\"I guess not,\" he answered. He stepped out of her office, pulling the door shut behind him.\nAs the door clicked shut, the hardwood floor of the office was instantly replaced with muddy grass. Heavy drops of rain pelted him from dark clouds hanging in the sky. A chill wind blew right through the thin jacket he was wearing.\nRoger looked around. He was standing in a cemetery. There was Liz, standing over an open grave, clinging tightly to an umbrella. A preacher of some kind stood in front of the grave, droning on in the bored tone of a man who wasn't getting paid enough to eulogize a man he didn't care about.\nLiz lifted her gaze from the grave, and her tear filled eyes met Roger's. He turned and started to walk away, but stopped. Roger turned back and looked at her. She was still staring at him, but now her expression turned to confusion.\nRoger hesitated a moment longer, then started walking toward her. She seemed to recoil slightly as he came and stood next to her. He looked at the grave marker. It was for Liz's dad.\nThe two of them stood there wordlessly while the preacher finished his ceremony. Finally, he snapped his book closed, and nodded in the direction of the two of them. The preacher turned on heel, and left them standing by the open grave.\n\"I'm sorry, about your dad,\" Roger said finally.\n\"Thanks,\" Liz said softly. \"You haven't talked to me in a long time.\"\n\"Not since high school.\"\n  \"I thought all those times I saw you walking away meant I was getting better. Somehow I'm glad that you're here though. It's better than being alone. But I guess this means I'm still crazy,\" she said.\n  Roger looked at her, studying her expression. \"Who isn't these days?\" he asked after a pause.\n  She let a small laugh escape her lips. Liz looked at him, and smiled. It was the first time Roger had seen that since they had broken up.\n\"Would you stay here with me a while?\" she asked softly, tears starting to well back up in her eyes.\n\"Sure,\" Roger answered. What did he have to lose?\n"
